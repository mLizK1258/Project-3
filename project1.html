          <h4>Web Interface Design</h4>
          <div class="mb-5">
            <p>In this project, I had the opportunity to explore how to do a website of interface design. Through the
              combination of coding and UX/UI design, I was able to bring a new way for interface for our idea, which is
              Plant Furniture.

            greenery into their living spaces, but may lack knowledge about the different types of plants available and
            how to maintain them. Additionally, the website should also take into consideration the environmental impact
            of the products it offers and promote sustainable practices. The website should focus on
            the website's design, usability, and sustainability features to identify areas of improvement and enhance
            the user experience.</p>

          <h1 class="large-font" style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"><b>Solution</b></h1>
          <p>The website involves the development<span style="font-size:26px"> an effective classification system for
              the different types of plants and furniture products </span>available on the website. This will allow
            users to easily browse and find the specific products they are interested in. In addition, providing
            detailed information on each product, such as ideal growing conditions and care instructions, will enable
            users to make informed decisions about which plants are best suited for their indoor environments.
            Incorporating a responsive design and ensuring the website is user-friendly will further enhance the overall
            user experience.</p>

      <h2>Interface</h2>
      <p>We aim to create a plant furniture website that is visually refreshing and appealing. During the first week of
        the project, we may have been too preoccupied with the website's interface design, which may have resulted in
        inadequate focus on the coding aspect. Consequently, our web 1 check did not yield the desired results.

    <div id="b2" class="process-containerTab" style="display:none;background:#a6f9ff">
      <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">&times;</span>
      <h2>Hardware Error</h2>
      <p>During the third week of this exercise, my computer crashed while attempting to retrieve the completed portion
        of my mate's work. As a result, I had to reach out to a team mate and request that they rewrite the code for me.
        This process was quite time-consuming and made it difficult for me to verify whether the code was being executed
        correctly or not.

    <div id="b3" class="process-containerTab" style="display:none;background:#df8383">
      <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">&times;</span>
      <h2>Responsive Error</h2>
      <p>During the auditing process of the website, we discovered some responsive errors in the themes which caused the
        website to crash frequently. We found that the issue arose due to our failure to use the appropriate media
        queries method and selecting incorrect parameters. As a result, the website was not effectively responding to
        other devices. We have since rectified this error and resolved the issue.

          <h1 class="large-font"><b>Future development</b></h1>
          <p>One potential future development for the analysis process of the plant furniture website could be the
            implementation of sorting recommendations for users based on their options. Additionally, the website could
            incorporate user feedback and reviews to continuously improve the accuracy of these recommendations over
            time.

          <p>During the project, I built the Evergreen website and learned a lot about website design principles and user
            experience. I also gained insight into the importance of visual hierarchy on incorporating branding and marketing strategies
            into website design. Through the process, I improved my website developer for both usability and accessibility. Overall, the project allowed me to deepen my understanding of website design and user
            experience, while also developing valuable skills for future projects.</p>
