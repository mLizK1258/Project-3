      <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Introduction</p>
      <p>This is a group assignment for creating company website, my partner is Yenan Huang.
        We have 4 weeks to completed the project and we used HTML and CSS to create this website.
        I learn a lot about creating a website and website designing. I will be going through my process
        of designing this website.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Week 1</p>
      <p>In the first week, me and my partner create a simple layout on Figma to help us visualize the layout for the
        website.
        Our target for the website is a young people, so we tried to do the "clean" layout as much as we can with the
        simple design
        but are still very attractive.
        <img src="img/step1p1.PNG" alt="project 1">

      <p>After we finished the layout, me and Yenan started doing our own part for each page of the website.
        In the first week, I completed the layout About page for the company, and adding some images for partnerships.
      </p>

      <img src="img/step3p1.PNG" sizes="80%" alt="project 1">
    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Week 2</p>
      <p>In the second week, we started doing the layout for our product listings page. In this page, I took a
        resonsibility to do it. The layout is taken inspiration from W3School - 3 columns layout on HTML and CSS.
        This is the lay out of the tutorial.
      </p>
      <img src="img/step4p1.PNG" alt="project 1">
      <p>After spending 2 days, this is a result of my layout design. Add more text, reviews, and price of product

        <img src="img/step5p1.PNG" alt="project 1">
    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Week 3</p>
      <p>As a business company, the website should have the payment and checkout product as well. Even the assignment
        is from Project 1 of my partner, we want to do the new layout to fit with our theme concept as a business
        company.
        We also did the simple layout for these 2 pages on Figma then tried to applied it on the website by HTML and
        CSS.
      </p>
      <img src="img/step6p1.PNG" sizes="80%" alt="project 1">

      <p>I took responsibility for this page. I do not have much knowledge so I also learned this layout on W3S.
        After 1 day, this is a new layout of the checkout page.
      <p>

    </div>

    <div class="process">
      <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Week 4 - Conclusion</p>
      <p>The project went fairly well and is one of the best project I did as a group assignment. The design got a
        positive feedback from our teaching team and peers in the course as well. I wish we could have more time to
        improve the layout because there are some issues relatin to the responsive design and might add more things.
        Overall, this assignment give me a chance to create engaging and interesting website as a student following
        graphic design, especially focus on the Ux/Ui path.
