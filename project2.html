          <h4>Mobile Interface Design</h4>
          <div class="mb-5">
            <p>This project helped me had the opportunity to explore how to do a mobile interface with a specific target user, which is elderly above 75 years old. Through the
              combination of UX/UI design and user researching, I was able to bring a new way for interface for our idea, which is
              SeventyFiverr.

          <p>We conducted research on potential activities for senior citizens, while also gathering user stories. Meet Sam, a 76-year-old retiree who recently left her job at a local bank and is now feeling bored. With a strong interest in finance and a solid understanding of financial planning, Sam is seeking part-time or freelance work as a financial advisor. Through extensive research, advice from acquaintances, and offering her services to friends and family, Sam successfully established a client base and expanded her business. As a freelance financial advisor, she found satisfaction in assisting others in reaching their financial objectives while maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

      <h2>Interview</h2>
      <p>One challenge in interviewing elders for a freelancer mobile application is the need for clear and concise language. Elderly individuals may have difficulty understanding complex or technical terms, so it is important to use simple language and avoid jargon. Additionally, older adults may have varying levels of familiarity with technology, so it is important to be patient and provide clear instructions during the interview process. It may also be helpful to conduct the interview in a comfortable and familiar setting for the elderly person.

      <h2>Empowering Seniors (with work contract idea)</h2>
      <p>The objective of this challenge is to create an app that empowers elderly individuals to find and secure freelance work. To empower and protect elders, we come up with a unique work contract idea that ensures seniors are protected and valued in the marketplace. The goal is to create a platform that provides equal opportunities to all freelancers, regardless of their age, and allows seniors to leverage their experience and expertise to secure work.

      <h2>Interface</h2>
      <p>The challenge with App Interface is to create a user interface that is easy to use and visually appealing for elderly users. The app developers need to ensure that the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear and concise instructions. The interface should be designed with large, easy-to-read fonts and high-contrast colors to ensure maximum visibility for elderly users. The goal is to create an interface that is engaging and user-friendly, which will encourage elderly users to use the app regularly.

          <h1 class="large-font"><b>Future development</b></h1>
          <p>One potential future development for creating a freelancer application for elderly individuals could be the implementation of virtual training programs. With virtual training, seniors would have access to a wide range of resources and tutorials that can teach them new skills, such as how to use the application, how to market themselves, and how to manage their finances.

          <h1 class="large-font"><b>Reflection</b></h1>
          <p>During the project, as a person following UX/UI, I learned a lot about putting user in center principles and user
            experience. I also gained insight how to design an application with a specific target user. Through the process, I improved my researching and design for both usability and accessibility. Overall, the project allowed me to deepen my understanding of website design and user
            experience, while also developing valuable skills for future projects.</p>
